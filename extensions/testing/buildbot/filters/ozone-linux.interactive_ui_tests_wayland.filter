# TODO(https://crbug.com/1134495): 
# Will be enabled after input emulation lands (https://crrev.com/c/2726705)
# For now, all the tests are disabled as their initialization fails because of the
# lack of the input emulation. It's easier to disable them via a filter instead of
# keeping a separate list of gtests.
