# About

`basic` extends `base` library from chromium https://github.com/chromium/chromium/tree/master/base

`basic` can use only same libs that `base` uses.

`basic` is pulled into many projects.

So the bar for adding stuff is that it must have demonstrated wide applicability.

Pull into `basic` only when needed.

In a project our size, sometimes even duplication is OK and inevitable.
