// http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1315r5.html.
//
// This function is guaranteed to fill in the whole buffer
// and is not subject to compiler optimization as allowed by Sub-clause 5.1.2.3
// of C Standard [ISO/IEC 9899:2011] which states:
// In the abstract machine, all expressions are evaluated as specified by the
// semantics. An actual implementation need not evaluate part of an expression
// if it can deduce that its value is not used and that no needed side effects
// are produced (including any caused by calling a function or accessing
// a volatile object).
// While memset() can be optimized out in certain situations (since most
// compilers implement this function as intrinsic and know of its side effects),
// this function will not be optimized out.
//
// SecureClearBytes is used to write beyond the size() in several functions.
// Since this is intentional, disable address sanitizer from analyzing it.
