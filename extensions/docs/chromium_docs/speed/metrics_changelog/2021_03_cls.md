# Cumulative Layout Shift Changes in Chrome 91

### Ignore layout shift for more invisible elements

The following nodes are ignored for layout shift:
* texts with unrenderable font or containing all whitespaces,
* blocks without any decorations or any children.

If you still see layout shift reported for an invisible element, you can
try to add 'visibility:hidden' to the element's style.
