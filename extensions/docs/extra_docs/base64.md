# About

Base64 encoding: turning binary data into ASCII text
for the purpose of saving it to text files like XML,
or transmitting it over protocols like HTTP,
or embedding it into web page files, and many other purposed.
That’s the basic idea behind it.
For every 3 bytes of input you get 4 bytes of output,
so it’s not crazy inflated.

"Man is distinguished, not only by his reason, but by this singular passion from other animals, "
"which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continued and indefatigable "
"generation of knowledge, exceeds the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure."
