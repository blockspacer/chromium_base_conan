// WHAT:
// Type aliases for string and character types supporting UTF-16 data. Prior to
// C++11 there was no standard library solution for this, which is why wstring
// was used where possible (i.e. where wchar_t holds UTF-16 encoded data).
//
// In C++11 we gained std::u16string, which is a cross-platform solution for
// UTF-16 strings. This is now the string16 type where ever wchar_t does not
// hold UTF16 data (i.e. commonly non-Windows platforms). Eventually this should
// be used everywhere, at which point this type alias and this file should be
// removed. https://crbug.com/911896 tracks the migration effort.
